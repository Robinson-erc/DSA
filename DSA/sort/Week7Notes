-Sorting Algorithms
    -Given a list, arrange the values in increasing (or decreasing) order.

    -Selection Sort Algorithm
        -find the position of the smallest value, beginning at the start
            -Swap it with the start position.

            []      []       []      []       []
            smallest ^smallest             largest
    -x.compareTo(y)
        -returns negative if x is less than y
        -returns positive number if x is greater than y
        -returns x-y
        -so if x-y = 0 x equals y
    -Bubble Sort
        -Compare neighbors
        -Swap if necessary
        -Scanning list from start to end largest value is in correct spot
        -Repeat but don't look at the value at the end
        -Repeat . . . . . values at end
