Graphs
    -A graph is a set of nodes, connected with arcs
    -The arcs may be directed or undirected
    -The nodes may be labeled
    -Graph path Algorithms
        -find a path from any node to any other node if possible.

    -in our graph our nodes represent an airport
    -arcs represent directed flights from one airport to another
    -shortest path does not matter for this problem
