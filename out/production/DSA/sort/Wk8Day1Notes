-Quick Sort Algorithms
    -is the size < 2?
        -if so terminate
    -partition the list:
        -choose any value as Pivot
        -Arrange so that all values to the left of the pivot are strictly smaller
        and all values to the right of the pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.

                    p=position of pivot

    -use quicksort to sort the left part
    -use quicksort to sort the right part
    -Choose a value as the pivot
    -Make a copy of the picot in a local variable
    -set up a loop to scan the remaining values,
    moving them to the left of the pivot if they are smaller
    than the pivot.
