-int hashCode()
    -Should be overidden by the client
    -Requirement: if two keys are equal, they must have same hashCode
    -if k1.equals(k2)
        then
            k1.hashCode()==k2.hashCode();
    -For effieciency
        -if two keys are not equal, we would like their hashCodes to be differenct
        -If !k1.equals(k2)
            we hope that
                k1.hashCode()!=k2.hashCode();
