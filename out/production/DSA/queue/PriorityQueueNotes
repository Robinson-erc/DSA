-Priority Queue
    -A queue is a first in first out list
    -A priority queue removes the value with the highest priority
    -When removing from a priority queue return the value at position 0
    -The remaining values have to be a heap
    -Even when adding to the priorit queue you have to make sure the values are still in a heap
    -Adding to a priority Queue:
        -Add new largest value at the end
        -Swap it with its parent
        -Repeat until it is in the correct position
        -If it is not in the correct position
        -Swap it with its parent
        -Repeat until it is in the correct position
        -Return the value
        -Time Complexity: O(log(n))
     -to get the position of the parent value do (n-1)/2
